## Basic terminology

* **File system** The file system is how the files are stored and organized 
* **Current directory** is the directory one is currently working on 
* **Parent directory** backwards from the previous directory 
* **The difference between your home directory and the home directory** "Your home directory" is the terminal emulator which is the current working directory. Compared to "the home directory" it is the home directory in the root. 
* **Pathname** the location of the file in the file system 
* **Relative path** starts with a subdirectory and it is a directory that is found inside the current working directory 
* **Absolute path** always starts with / and it is the location of a file starting from the root of the file system
