## Other Relevant Concepts/New Concepts Learned
* **Systemd** supplies a variety of Linux-based features
* **Virtual hosts** Virtual Host enables running several websites on a single device or web server
* **Port 88** UDP port 88 uses the Datagram Protocol, a communications protocol for the Internet network layer, transport layer, and session layer. This protocol when used over PORT 88 makes possible the transmission of a datagram message from one computer to an application running in another computer.
* **Systemctl Command** This command controls both system and service configurations, giving administrators access to the OS and service performance.
